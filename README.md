# binarizing_images_for_cell_counting
<<<<<<< HEAD
tiny project
=======
Firstly,I was trying to classify and count the RBC(red blood cell) and WBC(whiteblood cell) with CNN, but the result turned out weird. So I decided to change another traditional method which is the binarization.
The following methods will also be included in the codes:
###Cluster Processing
###Color Gamut Segementation
###Morphology Processing
