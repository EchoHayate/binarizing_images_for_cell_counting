# binarizing_images_for_cell_counting
Firstly, I was trying to classify and count the RBC (red blood cell) and WBC (white blood cell) with CNN,<br>

but the result turned out weird. So I decided to change to another traditional method which is binarization.<br><br>



The following methods will also be included in the codes:<br>

<h3>Cluster Processing</h3>

<h3>Color Gamut Segmentation</h3>

<h3>Morphology Processing</h3>
